# About Me

I am a 5th year medical student at Imperial College London with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering.
My main interest is in using statistical and machine learning approaches to optimise clinical workflow and decision making.

I have worked on projects involving Medical Imaging (chest X-rays, CT thorax/abdomen) and Electrocardiograms. A [project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08840) I recently worked on with [VUNO](https://vuno.co) was accepted to the [ML4H workshop](https://ml4health.github.io/2018/pages/papers.html) at NeurIPS 2018.   

In my spare time, I like to go rock climbing or practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
