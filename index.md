# About Me

I am a 5th year medical student at Imperial College London with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering.
My main interest is in using statistical and machine learning approaches to optimise clinical workflow and decision making.

I have worked on projects involving Medical Imaging (chest X-rays, CT thorax/abdomen) and Biosignals (Electrocardiograms). A [project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08840) I worked on with [VUNO](https://vuno.co) was accepted to the ML4H workshop at NeurIPS 2018.
